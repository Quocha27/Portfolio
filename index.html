                Hi, My name is Quoc and I'm very excited to start my coding journey at UCI! My hobbies are hanging out with my family and enjoying quality drinks. I also enjoy playing basketball and playing video games during my free time. My new hobby will be coding! Some of the other things I do on my free time is hang out with my three year old nephew. We like to play hide and seek, basketball and watch Marvel shows and movies. I just got married to my best friend last year and before we got engaged we were dating for 10 years (I proposed on our 10 year anniversary in Kauai). My goals after this bootcamp is to find a stable well paying career and also to gain all the knowledge I can to become an elite coder.
